# ⚽ Football Data Experiments – Inverted Nonsense

This repo is a playground for exploring football (soccer) data — from expected goals models to passing networks and tactical visualizations.

Most of these experiments support content published on my Substack, [Inverted Nonsense](https://invertednonsense.substack.com/), where I write about the game with data, storytelling, and the occasional emotional spiral.

## 🛠️ Tools & Stack

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, networkx)
- Data: public match/event datasets, custom scraped stats
- Focus: exploratory analysis, visualizations, model building
